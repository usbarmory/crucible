# Kontron Electronics GmbH modules and boards (SL/OSM-S/BL/AL/DL i.MX6UL) are
# shipped with UIDs for module and board in the GP1/GP2 registers. There's
# also a second MAC address for the USB ethernet adapter programmed to the
# unused slot in the OCOTP_MAC_ADDR1 and OCOTP_MAC_ADDR2 registers. This also
# adds an alias for the first MAC address to make them distinguishable more
# easily.
